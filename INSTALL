CmsForNerd is really for nerd. You need to know basic HTML, CSS and PHP to maintain it because it is not like any other content Management Software or CMS. We build CmsForNerd because we want to learn about HTML and how to code in PHP.

CmsForNerd is for a small website, with static contents that not always need to be change. CmsForNerd is not using any database. We want a CMS that it is simple, easy to backup and recovery because we don't want to be worried about any lost of data in database due to hardware failure.

We also build CmsForNerd so it is search engine friendly to Google and Yahoo. You can used HTML Validator add-on for Mozilla Firefox  to validate yout HTML page.
